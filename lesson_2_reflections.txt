What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The directory became a valid git repository and I can log my entire history of changing files and be able to restore to my previous version when necessary.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area includes only the files that you've made the git add command to and have not yet commited.
